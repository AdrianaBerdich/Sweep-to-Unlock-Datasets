# Fingerprinting Smartphones based on Loudspeaker Roll-off Characteristics

Abstract: Fingerprinting smartphones based on acoustic characteristics of their loudspeaker may have a number of applications in device-to-device authentication as well as in forensic investigations. In this work we propose an efficient fingerprinting methodology by using the roll-off characteristics of the device speaker, i.e., the transition between the low and high stopbands to the passband segment of the speaker. We extract roll-off characteristics from sweep signals, also know as chirps, that are commonly used in practice to test speaker response. This procedure appears to be more stable against variations of the volume level and allows the use of simple linear approximations, which are intuitive and easy to compute, in order to extract the fingerprint. To increase detection accuracy, on the basis of the proven performance of deep learning techniques, a convolutional and a bi-directional long short term memory neural network are further proposed and their performance demonstrated for authentication purposes. While numerous applications may be envisioned, we specifically focus on the use of speaker characteristics in relation to in-vehicle infotainment units, checking if recordings from these units can be used to fingerprint a specific phone.

# 1. Concept
We fingerprint smartphones based on their loudspeaker response to sweep signals (also known as chirps). As a potential area of application we target in-vehicle environment, a reason for which the recordings were performed with an in-vehicle Android headunit.

# 2. Dataset
Dataset content The dataset is structured as described below. We provide the clean recordings as audio data (PCM or WAV) as well as the power spectrum (FFT as .txt). For recordings affected by noise, we provide only the FFT results (as .txt).

Note that the RAW files are very large and uncut, it is advisable that you use the FFT extractions.

## File structure ##

The RAW RECORDINGS folder contains the clean recordings as audio data. For clean recordings with distinct speakers we used WAV files, each file contains one linear sweep. For clean recordings with identical speakers we used PCM files, each file contains slightly over 100 linear sweeps.

The FFT EXTRACTIONS folder contains the power spectrum of the liner sweep signal for the identical speakers (with and without noise). For each sample we build a .TXT file which contains two columns, the first column represents the frequency and the second is the amplitude of the power spectrum for the specific frequency. There are 1914 lines in each file which represent the amplitudes of the power spectrum between 700Hz and 11kHz at ~5Hz resolution.
